# Stopwatch
Simple web stopwatch for first project as part of IoT Blockchain Technology Course 

NOTE THAT THIS STOPWATCH IS NOT ACCURATE AS IT USES THE NOTORIOUSLY UNRELIABLE setInterval() FOR INCREMENTING SECONDS, WHICH RESULTS IN DRIFT OF APPROX 1 SECOND EVERY 5 MINUTES. SEE MY MilliSecStopwatch REPOSITORY FOR AN ACCURATE STOPWATCH WHICH CALCULATES ELAPSED TIME IN MILLISECONDS USING THE Date() OBJECT INSTEAD.

Opening the HTML file in a web browser should produce a simple stopwatch which includes timer display, reset button and stop/start toggle button.
The styling of the HTML elements is achieved using CSS while the functionality is written in JavaScript.
All three files should be stored in the same folder to work together.
